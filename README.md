### About the Project

This project was created as an assignment submitted for GDD-140 at Quinnipiac University. This assignment uses [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) to create a visual art on a canvas through javascript. Instead of using the suggested [p5.js editor](https://editor.p5js.org/), I decided to instead install p5.js locally and create it using vscode.

### Viewing the Project

The compiled project is automatically hosted on GitHub Pages for those who wish to simply see it. The link to the project is above, or in the description panel of this repo.

### Running the Project Yourself

If you want to download the project and take a deeper look into the code, you are welcome to! Below are instructions on how to download and work with the project:

1. **Required Programs** Running this program will require a few package managers and programs, as listed below.
   - [**git**](https://git-scm.com/): shouldn't be a surprise, you will need git in order to clone this repository
   - [**npm**](https://www.npmjs.com/): This project uses **npm** to download and manage the **p5.js** package, as well as its types. You can install **npm** by following steps on their [downloading documentation page](https://docs.npmjs.com/downloading-and-installing-node-js-and-npm).
   - [**Visual Studio Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/): I used Visual Studio Code to create this project, and I suggest the program to those just wanting to fool around. I've included suggested packages in the repository, which VSCode will prompt you to install. If you are comfortable with other editors, please use whatever you want.

```bash
cd GDD-140-Template
npm install
```
